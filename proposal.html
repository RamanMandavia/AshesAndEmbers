           Survive by scavenging your surroundings for food and resources. When darkness falls, fiery

       </h2>

       <p>
           A post-apocalyptic, scorched world. Somber and muted during the day, deadly and terrifying at night. Always tense. Move about 
           the destroyed world to find resources, used for food and interaction with the environment. When night falls, the 
           scavenging does not end. Instead, it becomes far more dangerous with the appearance of walking flames. Alongside searching for 
           resources and hiding from these creatures, search for a safe haven. Somewhere where there may be others.

       <p>
           Art - Pixelated, but not cartoonish carries the theme and mood of the game in the art. Decrepit and ashen.
       </p>
        <p>
           Sound - Simple. Footsteps, interaction sounds, a death sound, trailing fire for the monsters, and possible ambient sounds. Synthesized/8 or 16 bit.
       </p>
        <p>
           Music - Music will carry the theme and mood as well, put together with guitars and possible synthesizer effects. Two iterations: day and night.

           VI. Gameplay
       </h2>

       <p>
           Mechanics - The player must search for resources by moving around the game world and interacting with piles of objects, chests, visually disfigured parts of the gound, and 
           ruins of buildings. When examined, "Food" or Resources can be found, or the player may find nothing at all. Food can be consumed to increase the player's Survival 
           Time, which is similar to health in that when it reaches 0, the game ends. Resources are used to open the chest that contains the key to the Safe Haven, as well as unlocking ruins so that they may be hidden within. Enemies spawn 
           when darkness falls, emittings a faint glow. The player must find something to hide within to avoid these. They will seek the player and result in death if they come in contact. When the player is hidden
           Somewhere in the map is a Safe Haven. If the player reaches this, they win. However, entering the Safe Haven requires a key that is foudn within a locked chest.
       </p>
        <p>
            Controls - <br>W, A, S, D to move; <br>SPACE to search objects, and interact with ruins and the Safe Haven (unlocking or hiding within them); <br>E to exit ruins when hidden; <br>F to consume food
