               - W3Schools was used as reference for: CSS background-color Property, CSS Layout - The position Property,
               and CSS Web Fonts. Additionally, the in-class exercise and demo for responsive design was used.
           </p>
           <p>
               - All images used (background, screenshot, and game objects) were created by me using Piskel.
           </p>
           <p>
               - All fonts are unique, fully commercial-usable, and from DaFont.com
           </p>
           <p>
               - The nav for proposal sections (which are ironically articles) is always on screen, and distinct from the other nav.
               The footer is also always on screen, and changes for the mobile version of the site.
               Only the main nav, Overview screenshot, footer, and a few font sizes require changing for the mobile version.
               The rest naturally changes due to elements being based on percentage. Additionally, responsive 
               design occurs above 480px, as the Documentation nav element takes up too much space. Well above, actually - at 780px. The re-format functions perfectly for mobile 
               sizes, and also fixes the issues that arise after getting to a width below 780px.
